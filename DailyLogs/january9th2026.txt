my learning : 

1. understood project file structure - gained a little clarity on cmake and build script(build.sh)

2. understood about linker by tinkering functions in various translation unit in the same project(also resolved concept of external symbol error during linking) 

3. understood what is translation unit 

4. understood basic flow of compilation (cleared some doubts of the previous day)

5. explored datatypes(int,char,string,bool,double,float,auto) - looked at their sizes and their usages

6. understood about type casting - tinkered a code and applied this concept

7. attempted c++ quizes on w3school platform - (datatype)
